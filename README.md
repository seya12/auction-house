# auction-house
solution for homework 2 in SWT
- using JPA for an auction house - main focus on entity-mapping and repositories - no auction logic

How to start:
- execute the derby:run maven task for a local derby database (connection string: jdbc:derby://localhost/Auction;create=true)
- execute swt.auction.Main for a console application
- integration tests start an embedded derby instance, step 1 is therefore not required.
